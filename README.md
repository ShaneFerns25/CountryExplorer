## Setting up, starting & using the application:
> After cloning the application from Github, open the applications root directory in a source code editor and open two seperate terminals. In one terminal run 'cd client' command to go into the client directory and in the other terminal run 'cd server' command to go into the server directory.

> In the terminal with the server directory, run 'cat .env' to create a .env file to store environment variables. Enter: PORT=9000
inside the file to store the PORT.

> Next run 'npm i' command inside both terminals, this will install all dependencies listed in the package.json files for both client and server.

> Once finished, run 'npm start' command in the terminal with the server directory to start the server, similarily run the same command in the terminal with the client directory, this will start up our client.

> Finally, hold ctrl and click on the link shown in the terminal with the client directory to visit the website
OR
directly copy paste: http://localhost:3000/
in the url of your web browser.
